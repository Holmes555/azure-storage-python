## Getting started
As usual for Python projects:
```bash
# create virtual environment
python -m venv env

# activate virtual environment (Linux:)
source env/bin/activate

# activate virtual environment (Windows:)
env\Scripts\activate

# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# enjoy
```

To verify how this code works, simply see the content of `tests` folder for working examples, code is kept simple and stupid there; it's sufficient to provide valid account name and admin key.

```python
# replace with valid values;
ACCOUNT_NAME = '<ACCOUNT_NAME>'
ACCOUNT_KEY = '<ACCOUNT_KEY>'
```
